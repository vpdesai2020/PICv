Protein interaction clustering and visualization is an pioneer attempt in understanding protein-protein interaction at a residue level. For any given protein the interaction is purely dependent on its charges and surface-structural modifications. The clustering of proteins based on there preferential amino acid interactions provides a biological insight on both the above mentioned aspects. The clusters such obtained can be used to infer the interaction behavior for a class or family of proteins. Such interpretation can be useful in understanding structural protein chemistry. The interactions also provide information on the crucial amino acids required for interactions to remain stable. This information can be used to design antibody or induce mutations to depreciate its functionality
